## Dan Bolger

A friendly, enthusiastic junior developer with a passion for quality UX, visualised data and inspiring content. 

I took the decision to join Makers Academy after several years at the forefront of online customer service, which piqued my interest in the inner workings of the web. I spent a lot of time offering expert support to users of a complex product - I wanted to find out what was going on behind the scenes!

Having graduated in 2015, I'm ready for a fresh new challenge with a fresh new career as a web developer. With a proven background navigating UX from a non-technical standpoint I'm looking forward to engaging with the full stack to help deliver feature-rich, intuitive web applications which offer users lasting solutions to complicated problems.

## Skills

#### Ruby/Rails

Using the baseline Ruby/Rails skills taught at Makers I've contributed to a number of projects, both individually and within groups. Ruby is my go-to language, and has been great to learn with; I enjoy its intuitiveness, expressivity and its scope for simplicity.

- Started fresh with very basic Ruby, skilling up to produce full web apps in teams
- Created a web front-and-back-end, registering businesses for an online checkin/treeplanting app. Implemented maps and visual data based on checkins [live on heroku here](https://treemo-dev.herokuapp.com/)

#### Javascript

I love the power of Javascript, and its flexibility. Whilse syntactically unforgiving, JS enables the kind of SPAs which are part of the reason I wanted to get into coding.

- Progressed from a simple pure Javascript thermostat app (https://polar-basin-3888.herokuapp.com/) to more interactive projects, using different JS-flavoured technologies (Angular, Node, Express etc)

#### Customer Service/Startup experience

Fully-fledged 'helper of people' with a number of interesting specializations:

- Bug reporting - taking reports from within Airbnb CS, verifying and finding workarounds, and reporting true positives to the engineering team in SF
- Online investigation - identifying bad actors on the site, problem solving, verifying user information across platforms
- Strong soft skills, communication across teams as well as directly with the userbase - one often unfamiliar with (or daunted by) technology
- UX - helped spec out the admin section of ihateironing.com bringing my experience and knowledge to the task of making navigation of the back end and CRM easier for the business users
- Assorted Zendesk wizardry
