## Dan Bolger

A friendly, enthusiastic junior developer with a passion for visualised data, quality UX and engaging and inspiring content. 
I took the decision to join Makers Academy after several years at the forefront of online customer service, which piqued my interest in the technical side - basically, wanting to find out what was going on behind the scenes.

Having graduated in 2015, I'm ready for a fresh new challenge with a fresh new career as a web developer, as part of an ongoing quest to find out how everything works - and how to get it to do what I want. With a proven background navigating UX from a non-technical standpoint I'm looking forward to engaging with the full stack to help deliver feature-rich, intuitive web applications.

## Skills

#### Ruby/Rails

Using the baseline Ruby/Rails skills taught at Makers I've contributed to a number of projects, both individually and within groups

- Started fresh with very basic Ruby, skilling up to produce full web apps in teams
- Created a web front-and-back-end, registering businesses for an online checkin/treeplanting app. Implemented maps and visual data based on checkins [live on heroku here](https://treemo-dev.herokuapp.com/)

#### Javascript

For me JS is 'where the magic happens' - I love the power of Javascript, and its flexibility. Whilst syntactically unforgiving, JS enables the kind of SPAs which are part of the reason I wanted to get into coding.

- Progressed from a simple pure Javascript thermostat app (https://polar-basin-3888.herokuapp.com/) to more interactive projects, using different JS-flavoured technologies - Angular, Node, Express etc

#### Customer Service/Startup experience

Fully-fledged 'helper of people' with a number of interesting specializations:

- Bug reporting - taking reports from within Airbnb CS, verifying and finding workarounds, and reporting true positives to the engineering team in SF
- Online investigation - identifying bad actors on the site, problem solving, verifying user information across platforms
- Strong soft skills, communication across teams
- Assorted Zendesk wizardry
